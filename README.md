# skeleton-of-the-application-controlling-the-3d-printer
skeleton of a console application in C# communicating via a serial port.

The application sends the control data from the txt file through the UART port to the control board.

I have included a sample txt control file in the repository (Test_file.txt).

main.cpp file is an example Arduino program using uart communication

The application is only an early skeleton and does not have all the functionalities.
